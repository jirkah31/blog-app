As we watched our bulldog snooze through the day, we started to wonder, how many hours of sleep do bulldogs need every day? And should we be concerned by how much our English bulldog was sleeping during the day?",

  title: "Do English Bulldogs Get Car Sick?",
  perex: "If you’re the lucky owner of an English bulldog you know how wonderfully patient, fun-loving, and loyal they can be. They make excellent companions and want to be with you wherever you go. Unfortunately, if where you’re going means getting there by car, you might have to deal with your bullie buddy getting car sick on occasion. Car sickness, technically known as motion sickness, is prevalent among most breeds of dog and the English Bulldog is no exception. Like some humans, a car in motion gets their stomach-churning and can make them vomit. Unlike humans, your English bulldog won’t let you know if they’re feeling car sick before they vomit, which can lead to some truly gross situations. In this article, Do English Bulldogs Get Car Sick, we’ll take a look at why English bulldogs get car sick, what causes it, and what you can do to prevent them from turning your car or truck into a scene out of The Exorcist. Enjoy!",
